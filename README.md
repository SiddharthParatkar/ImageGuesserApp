# Overview
This is the second project I ever used Flutter and Dart in. This code was created as a part of the course "Learn Flutter and Dart: Complete App Development Projects" that I took on StackSkills. The image guesser lets the user choose from a list of items what the image in front of them on the app is.

# Skills
Primarily Flutter and Dart. The code for this project was made in Android Studio and used the Android and iOS emulators provided by the technology in order to test it.
